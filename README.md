### Description

A fancy but yet sophisticated light designer color scheme for the Atom Editor.

Originally forked from the beatiful One Light Theme, enhanced with the meaningful intuitive bluloco color palette.

This theme also works very good when Apple's **Nightshift Mode** is activated.

Give it a try :)
